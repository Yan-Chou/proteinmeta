Add the Django server code here. The database module and manage.py script
access it, and assume the web app is called presenter_webapp and the project
presenter_api.

Expected steps:
1. Clone the presenter_api project into the server folder.
2. Execute the command: "export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE='server.presenter_api.settings'"
3. Run the command: "python3 manage.py makemigrations presenter_webapp". This
should generate a new folder "migrations" and file. The command should also say
something similar to "Create model PresenterDataViz".
4. Run the command: "python3 manage.py migrate". This should generate a SQL
table in the server folder, which contains at least one table with the prefix
"presenter_webapp" in the name.

At this point the database is ready to receive data entries.

If the server should be accessed with a browser, run the command "python3
manage.py runserver" and follow the instructions for how to access the views.
