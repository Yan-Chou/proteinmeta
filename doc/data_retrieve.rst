Retrieval of Protein Data
-------------------------
The protein data can be retrieved via third-party Web APIs. The details of the
Web APIs are hidden to the user, who only configure the call to the APIs via
class methods, as described below. The raw data obtained are passed to a
parser, which translate the raw data into an object on which analysis is
applied. Alternatively, the raw data can be read from files stored on the local
disk, then passed to the parser.
